## Engineering Standards

All contributions must follow our engineering guidelines:

- **TDD** — write the test first, then the implementation
- **SOLID principles** — especially Single Responsibility
- **One function, one job** — every function does exactly one thing and is named after what it does

Read the full guide: [`docs/engineering-guidelines.md`](docs/engineering-guidelines.md)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One feature or fix per PR
- Reference the issue your PR closes: `Closes #42`
- Write a clear description — what changed and why
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review (`cargo test` + `pnpm test`)
- Every new function must have a corresponding test — no exceptions
