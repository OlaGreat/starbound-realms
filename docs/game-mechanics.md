# Game Mechanics

This document describes the full game mechanics of Starbound Realms.

## The Galaxy

The galaxy is a procedurally generated grid of star systems, initialized once when the `galaxy-map` contract is deployed. The grid size is configurable at deploy time (e.g. 20×20 = 400 systems).

Each star system has:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `coord_x`, `coord_y` | Grid coordinates — determines adjacency for fleet movement |
| `owner` | Stellar address of the current owner, or unclaimed |
| `resource_type` | One of: Iron, Energy, Plasma |
| `resource_yield` | Amount of resources produced per mining cycle (10–50 units) |
| `defense_rating` | Base defense value (5–20), adds to defender fleet stats in battle |
| `last_claimed` | Ledger timestamp of the last mining action |

---

## Claiming a System

Any player can claim an unclaimed star system by calling `galaxy-map.claim_system`. Requirements:
- The system must have no current owner
- The player must sign the transaction (Soroban auth enforced)

Once claimed, the system appears in the player's owned systems list and begins producing resources.

---

## Resources

Three resource types exist, each issued as a native Stellar asset:

| Resource | Symbol | Primary use |
|---|---|---|
| Iron | `IRON` | Build Scout, Fighter, Cruiser units |
| Energy | `NRGY` | Build Dreadnoughts, power fleet movement |
| Plasma | `PLSM` | Advanced units and future upgrades |

Resources are mined by calling `resources.mint` (triggered by the game after a mining cycle). Since they are real Stellar assets, players can:
- Hold them in their Freighter wallet
- Trade them freely on the Stellar DEX
- Send them to other players

**Mining cycle:** Resources accumulate passively. A player calls the mining function to claim their yield. The amount is based on the system's `resource_yield` value.

---

## Fleets

Each player has one fleet, tracked by the `fleet` contract. Fleets are composed of units:

| Unit | Attack | Defense | Iron cost | Energy cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scout | 2 | 1 | 10 | 5 |
| Fighter | 5 | 3 | 25 | 15 |
| Cruiser | 12 | 8 | 60 | 40 |
| Dreadnought | 30 | 20 | 150 | 100 |

**Building units:** Players call `fleet.build_unit`, spending resources from their balance. Units are added to their fleet immediately.

**Moving fleets:** Players call `fleet.move_fleet` to move to an adjacent system. Movement has a 60-second cooldown between moves.

- If the target system is **unclaimed** — the fleet moves and the player can claim it
- If the target system is **owned by another player** — a battle is triggered automatically

## Battle

Battle is resolved fully on-chain by the `battle` contract when a fleet moves into an occupied system.

**Resolution algorithm:**

1. Load attacker's total attack power (sum of all unit attack values)
2. Load defender's total defense power (sum of unit defense values + system `defense_rating`)
3. Run combat rounds using Soroban `Prng` (seeded per ledger — verifiable, not manipulable):
   - Each round both sides roll
   - Losing side of the round loses units proportional to damage dealt
4. Repeat until one side has no units remaining, or max rounds (20) reached
5. Winner is determined:
   - **Attacker wins** → `galaxy-map.transfer_ownership` is called, attacker takes the system
   - **Defender wins** → system stays, attacker fleet is reduced
6. Battle record is written to contract storage and emitted as a `battle_resolved` event

**Why on-chain randomness?** Soroban's `Prng` is seeded by the ledger sequence + contract address. Outcomes are deterministic given the same inputs and independently verifiable. Players cannot game the randomness by timing their transactions.

## Winning

There is no hard win condition — the galaxy is persistent. Players compete for:

- **Most systems owned** — tracked on the leaderboard
- **Most battles won** — tracked per player
- **Resource dominance** — players with high-yield systems accumulate resources faster

---

## Future Mechanics (open for contributors)

- **Alliance system** — players form alliances, share system defense
- **System upgrades** — spend Plasma to increase a system's defense or yield
- **Fleet specializations** — unit type bonuses against specific enemies
- **Seasonal resets** — optional governance-triggered galaxy resets
